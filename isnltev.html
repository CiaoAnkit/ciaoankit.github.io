					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Entry and Residence Procedure (TEV)</h2>
					The general steps in TEV are as follows:
						<ol>
							<li>Your employer will apply for advice from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) for your provisional residence permit (called MVV). MVV is the visa that you require to come to Netherlands when the foreign national intends to stay in Netherlands for more than 3 months. This step normally takes 3-4 weeks.</li>

							<li>Upon approval, a positive advice is sent to the Dutch Embassy in your country. The employee is required to get the MVV sticker on his/her passport from that embassy.</li>

							<li>Once you arrive in Netherlands, you must register at IND, townhall, and the tax office.</li>

							<li>Your residence permit will be issued within 8-12 weeks.</li>
						</ol>

					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Legalised Birth Certificate</h2>
					The general steps to obtain a legalised birth certificate for Netherlands visa/residence permit are as follows:
					<ol>
						<li>Get a fresh birth certificate issued. Please note that it should not be more than 6 months old, and the details in the birth certificate must match with the details in your passport. If the details do not match, get your birth certificate amended.

						<li>Get your birth certificate attested by the General Administration or Home department of the concerned state.
						<br>
						This step can take some time and may involve a pre-attestation by an authority at the concerned Birth and Death registration department. So, enquire at the state department or ask someone who has gone through the process in the concerned state.
						</li>

						<li>Get an apostille affixed on your birth certificate at Ministry of Foreign/External Affairs (usually located in the capital of the country).</li>

						<li>If your country is a member of Hague Convention, then an Apostille is enough for Netherlands, and legalization at Embassy is not required.</li>
						
					</ol>
					
					<hr style="margin-top:20px;">

					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Legalised Marriage Certificate</h2>
					The general steps to obtain a legalised marriage certificate for Netherlands visa/residence permit are as follows:
					<ol>
						<li>Get a marriage certificate issued from the Marriage registration department of the city where your marriage was formalized.</li>
						
						<li>Get your marriage certificate authenticated by the General Administration or Home department of the issuing state. Again, this step can take some time. </li>
						
						<li>Get an apostille affixed on your marriage certificate at Ministry of Foreign/External Affairs.</li>

						<li>If your country is a member of Hague Convention, then an Apostille is enough for Netherlands, and legalization at Embassy is not required.</li>
