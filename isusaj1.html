					<h2 style="text-align: center;">Visa Information</h2>
					If you are planning to go to the U.S. to participate in a cultural exchange program or for research purposes, you need a J visa. You need to apply for visa at the Embassy/Consulate office of U.S. in your country. The application procedure for J visas is as follows:

						<li>Create an account on <a target="_blank" class="blue" href="https://usvisa-info.com">https://usvisa-info.com</a>.</li>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Pay the non-refundable application fee (MRV fee^) online.</li>
							<li>Schedule an interview appointment with a consular office.</li>
						</ol>
						<li>Attend your interview appointment and bring all pertinent documentation:</li>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Confirmation page of Form DS-160.</li>
							<li>Valid passport.</li>
							<li>One passport size photo (see the <a target="_blank" class="blue" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/photos.html">photo specifications</a>).</li>
							<li>Duly completed Form DS-2019 issued from the school - in original.</li>
							<li>SEVIS payment receipt.</li>
							<li>Financial documentation (e.g., pay slips, tax returns, bank statement of the applicant or applicant's parents) that demonstrates the economic means to finance the entire course of study and stay in the U.S.</li>
							<li>The documentation that demonstrates your social and family ties to the country from where you are applying. Such documents include original residence permit for foreigners, family status, residence/marriage certificate, etc.</li>

						</ol>

						<ol type="i">

After a maximum of another three working days, the passport will be available for collection at the DHL location selected during the online registration process. Once your passport is at the DHL location, you will receive an e-mail by DHL with instructions on how to pick it up. If you select the home delivery option, delivery will take a few business days longer.</li>
						<li>If the visa is denied, your passport will be returned to you at the conclusion of the interview, along with a letter explaining the reasons for the visa refusal.</li>
						<li>Your application might receive a notice, sometimes referred to as a 221(g) notice, and sent for "Administrative Processing." This process can take some time. Meanwhile, you can check the status of your visa application <a target="_blank" class="blue" href="https://ceac.state.gov/ceacstattracker/status.aspx">here</a>.</li>
